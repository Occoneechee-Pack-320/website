						<p><b>Welcome to the fun and amazing world of Pack 320</b>, where the spirit of adventure and community thrives! For nearly 45 years, we have been proudly serving the Fuquay-Varina, NC community, and we couldn't be more excited about the incredible journey we embark on with each young scout who joins our ranks.</p>
						<p class="mt-4">At Pack 320, we believe in the power of the Cub Scout Motto, "<b>Do Your Best</b>" which lays the foundation for personal growth and achievement. We are committed to providing the absolute best program for every single scout and their families, ensuring that each one of them has an unforgettable experience with us.</p>
						<p class="mt-4">Our enthusiasm knows no bounds as we offer in-person meetings for boys and girls of all ranks &mdash; kindergarten through fifth grade. <b>Tuesday nights at 7pm</b> during the traditional school year come alive with energy and excitement at Fuquay-Varina United Methodist Church, our beloved gathering place located at <b>100 S. Judd Parkway, Fuquay-Varina, NC 27526</b>.</p>
						<p class="mt-4">Cub Scouts at Pack 320 don't just sit idle; they dive headfirst into a world of adventure! From camping trips that foster teamwork and camaraderie, to learning essential skills like knot-tying, shooting, and archery, our scouts are always on the move. Hiking becomes a thrilling exploration, campfires are moments to cherish as we sing and indulge in delicious s'mores, and engaging visits from local fire stations, police forces, and other first responders enrich our experiences throughout the year.</p>
						<p class="mt-4">We take pride in our annual events that bring families together. The Pinewood Derby is a spectacle of creativity and craftsmanship as our Cub Scouts showcase their best race cars. And there's nothing quite like our summer Fishing Derby, where young anglers learn the art of fishing and revel in the joy of catching their very first fish.</p>
						<p class="mt-4">Yet, amidst all the excitement, we instill in our scouts the value of personal responsibility, giving back to our community and being compassionate helpers to our neighbors. Throughout the year, we engage in meaningful service projects that teach the importance of making a positive impact on the world around us. </p>
						<p class="mt-4">At Pack 320, the Scout Law is not just a set of words; it's a guiding beacon that illuminates the path for our young scouts. We embrace these timeless values and strive to make them an integral part of everything we do. From the youngest Lion Cub to the seasoned Webelos, our scouts learn to be <b>trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent</b>. These principles not only shape them into responsible and respectful individuals but also empower them to be outstanding citizens and leaders in their communities. The <b>Scout Law</b> is the heart of our pack, fostering a sense of unity, integrity, and empathy among our scouts as they embark on a journey of self-discovery and character development. Together, we cultivate a sense of purpose and a lifelong commitment to making the world a better place, one small act of kindness at a time.</p>
						<p class="mt-4">Above all else, Pack 320 is about creating memories and friendships. We believe that the bonds formed within our pack last a lifetime, and we invite you to join us on this incredible journey of growth, learning, and fun. Together, we'll explore the world, challenge ourselves, and make cherished memories that will warm our hearts for years to come.</p>
						<p class="mt-4">So, whether you're experienced with what scouting has to offer or just starting out on your own new scouting adventure, Pack 320 welcomes you with open arms and a spirit of excitement! Come join us and be part of an extraordinary community where the possibilities are limitless. The adventure awaits!</p>
